Guidance it provides while driving is confusing and wrong most of the times. It fails when there are flyovers, multiple lanes and intersections, where it misguides and makes you take the wrong turn / lane. GOOGLE needs to overhaul the whole app. The only 2 advantages it has over other navigation maps is that it works offline and secondly it provides live traffic information with Data ON."

And I hope that they succeed in having Breezometer installed inside every automobile on the planet. It's a great idea.  If the dev team is listening, here are some issues that are worth sharing. I'm on Nexus 5x running Android 8.1. 1) Notifications are buggy. I don't receive push notifications about the air quality for my favorite locations unless I turn on notifications for each and every one of my favorite locations. :-/ 2) Why no homepage widget? 3) There could be more information about the pollutants - P2.5, P10, ozone, etc. What are those pollutants? What is responsible for generating them? How are they different from each other? 4) The map in the app is difficult to use. You can't zoom out. It forces you to zoom in when you try. And the street names often do not display - so if you want to search for air quality using the map itself it's very hard to understand where you are. 5) Most important!! The Android version of the app doesn't include Forecast/History information. Why does iOS and also your website have this, but not the Android app?"
